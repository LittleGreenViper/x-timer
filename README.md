INTRODUCTION
============
This is a basic countdown timer app. It was designed specifically for public speakers.

THIRD-PARTY CODE
================

This uses elements of [the excellent SwipeableTabBarController, by Marcos Griselli](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/SwipeableTabBarController) to handle an animated tab transition.

CHANGELIST
----------
***Version 2.0* ** *- TBD*

- The internal timer engine is now a centralized, atomic unit that handles the entire model layer. This is an internal change that is not apparent.
- The display for running timers now has a darker background.
- Added "swipe to select" functionality, with animated transitions.
- The alarm "flasher" is now animated.
- For Podium and Dual modes, transitions to warn and final are signaled by colored flashes.
- The Navigation Bar displayed text is now in a "digital" font.
- The digit separators are larger, and now blink when the timer is active (in Digital and Dual modes).
- There is a bit more space between the digits (In Digital and Dual modes).

***Version 1.5.0* ** *- July 1, 2017*

- This adds a Watch companion app, and has some cosmetic tweaks.
